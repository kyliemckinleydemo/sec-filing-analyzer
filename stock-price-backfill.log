[Deprecated] historical() relies on an API that Yahoo have removed.  We'll map this request to chart() for convenience, but, please consider using chart() directly instead; for more info see https://github.com/gadicc/node-yahoo-finance2/issues/795.  This will only be shown once, but you can suppress this message in future with `yahooFinance.suppressNotices(['ripHistorical'])`.
