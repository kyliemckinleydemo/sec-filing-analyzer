```

### Key Design Decisions

1. **Pattern-Based Predictions (MVP)**
   - Why: Faster to implement, no training data required
   - Trade-off: Lower accuracy than ML models
   - Upgrade path: Can train models on historical data

2. **In-Memory Caching**
   - Why: Simple, no external dependencies
   - Trade-off: Not persistent across restarts
   - Upgrade path: Redis for production

3. **SQLite Database**
   - Why: Zero configuration, perfect for development
   - Trade-off: Not suitable for high concurrency
   - Upgrade path: PostgreSQL via Supabase

4. **Mock Data Fallback**
   - Why: Allows testing without API keys
   - Trade-off: Not real analysis
   - Production: Requires valid API keys

## ⚠️ Known Limitations & Future Work

### Current Limitations
1. **Prediction Accuracy:** Pattern-based (not ML-trained)
   - Solution: Train models on historical data
   - Expected improvement: 50% → 65%+ accuracy

2. **Stock Price Data:** Limited to 100 days (Alpha Vantage free tier)
   - Solution: Premium API key or cache more aggressively
   - Cost: $50/month for premium

3. **Filing Content:** Using mock data for analysis demo
   - Solution: Parse actual HTML from SEC filings
   - Complexity: Medium (Item 1A, Item 7 extraction)

4. **No Authentication:** All data public
   - Solution: Implement NextAuth.js
   - Timeline: 1-2 days

### Technical Debt
- None significant - clean implementation
- Future: Consider Redis for production caching
- Future: Upgrade to PostgreSQL for production
