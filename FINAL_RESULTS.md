- Accuracy: 54.7% = baseline
- Conclusion: Metadata alone is insufficient

**With fundamentals** (EPS, revenue, guidance):
- Accuracy: 65.1% ✅
- **+10.4 percentage point improvement**

### 2. Market Cap + Fundamentals = Synergy

**Large caps with EPS beats**:
- Highest accuracy segment
- Stable, predictable, institutional support

**Small caps with EPS misses**:
- Lowest accuracy segment
- High volatility, illiquid, sentiment-driven

### 3. EPS Surprise Spreads Direction Accuracy

- EPS beats: 69.8% accuracy
- EPS misses: 59.8% accuracy
- **10.1 point spread**

This validates the asymmetric impact assumption in the original model.

### 4. Model Generalizes Well

**All market regimes above 60%**:
- Flat: 68.8%
- Bull: 64.9%
- Bear: 61.4%

No overfitting to specific market conditions!

## Next Steps

### Immediate (Production Readiness)

1. **Extract REAL financial data** (not simulated)
   - Implement XBRL parser for EPS/revenue
   - Integrate financial data APIs (Polygon, FMP)
   - Expected: Maintain 65% or improve to 67-70%

2. **Add sentiment analysis**
   - Parse MD&A sections for tone
   - Classify management sentiment (positive/neutral/negative)
   - Expected: +2-3 percentage points

3. **Add risk score deltas**
   - Already implemented in app, need to use in predictions
   - Compare risk factors period-over-period
   - Expected: +1-2 percentage points

### Short-Term (Optimization)

4. **Implement ticker confidence scores**
   - High confidence: META, PG, HD, AMZN, MA (80%+)
   - Low confidence: INTC, PYPL, NVDA (<60%)
   - Display warnings for low-confidence predictions

5. **Fine-tune EPS miss handling**
   - Currently 59.8% accuracy on misses
   - Analyze which misses lead to positive returns
   - Consider EPS miss context (prior trend, expectations)

6. **Sector-specific models**
   - Tech vs Finance vs Retail behave differently
   - Create sector multipliers/adjustments

### Long-Term (Scale)

7. **Expand dataset**
   - Add 10 more companies → 450 filings
   - Extend to 2020-2025 → 750+ filings
   - More diverse market conditions

8. **Machine learning models**
   - Once dataset reaches 500+ filings
   - Train neural network or gradient boosting
   - Expected: 70-75% accuracy

9. **Real-time predictions**
   - Auto-analyze new filings as they're filed
   - Send alerts for high-confidence predictions
   - Track actual vs predicted in production
