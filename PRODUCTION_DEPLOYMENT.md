## üìà Post-Deployment: Continuous Improvement

### Immediate Actions (Week 1)

1. **Monitor Live Predictions**
   - Track predictions in `/latest-filings`
   - Compare to 7-day actuals as they arrive
   - Log accuracy in production database

2. **A/B Test Model Versions**
   - Run v2.1 (simulated) vs v2.2 (real) in parallel
   - Measure which performs better on NEW filings

3. **Collect User Feedback**
   - Add feedback buttons to predictions
   - Track which predictions users trust
   - Identify confusing features

### Short-Term Improvements (Month 1)

4. **Add Ticker Confidence Scores**
   ```python
   # Based on historical accuracy
   HIGH_CONFIDENCE = ["HD", "JPM", "AMD", "PYPL", "MA"]  # >66%
   LOW_CONFIDENCE = ["NVDA", "TSLA", "INTC"]  # <50%
   ```
   - Display confidence badges on predictions
   - Warn users about low-confidence tickers

5. **Implement Risk Score Deltas**
   - Currently extracted but not used in predictions
   - Add Factor 1 weight adjustment
   - Expected: +1-2 percentage points

6. **Optimize EPS Miss Handling**
   - Current: EPS misses have 57.4% accuracy (better than beats!)
   - Hypothesis: Bull market dampening too strong
   - Test: Reduce dampening from 70% to 50%

### Medium-Term Enhancements (Months 2-3)

7. **Sector-Specific Models**
   - Tech vs Finance vs Retail behave differently
   - Create sector multipliers
   - Expected: +2-3 percentage points

8. **Expand Dataset**
   - Currently: 278 filings (2022-2025)
   - Target: 500+ filings (2020-2025, 30 companies)
   - More market regimes (COVID, rate hikes)

9. **Machine Learning Models**
   - Once dataset reaches 500+ filings
   - Train gradient boosting or neural network
   - Expected: 65-70% accuracy

### Long-Term Vision (Months 4-6)

10. **Real-Time Filing Monitor**
    - Auto-fetch new filings as they're submitted to SEC
    - Generate predictions immediately
    - Send alerts to users

11. **Consensus Estimates Integration**
    - Current: Period-over-period comparison
    - Better: Compare to analyst consensus
    - Requires paid API (Polygon, FMP, etc.)
    - Expected: +5-8 percentage points

12. **Options Strategy Recommendations**
    - Based on prediction + confidence
    - High confidence + high return ‚Üí Long calls
    - Low confidence ‚Üí Avoid position

---

## üìä Monitoring & Alerts

### Key Metrics to Track

1. **Model Performance**
   - Direction accuracy (rolling 30-day)
   - Mean absolute error
   - Accuracy by market cap category
   - Accuracy by ticker

2. **System Health**
   - API response times
   - Database query latency
   - Claude API rate limits
   - SEC EDGAR API failures

3. **User Engagement**
   - Daily active users
   - Most viewed companies
   - Prediction click-through rate
   - Time on latest filings page

### Alert Thresholds

```javascript
// Set up monitoring alerts
if (rollingAccuracy < 55%) {
  alert("Model accuracy below baseline!");
}

if (apiErrorRate > 5%) {
  alert("High API failure rate");
}

if (databaseLatency > 500ms) {
  alert("Database performance degraded");
}
```

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### 1. Low Prediction Accuracy
**Symptom**: Model predictions below 55%
**Causes**:
- Market regime changed (new bull/bear cycle)
- Dataset outdated (need fresh filings)
- Model weights need retuning

**Fix**:
```bash
# Collect new filings
python3 scripts/collect-full-dataset.py

# Re-run backtest
python3 scripts/backtest-with-real-data.py

# Update model weights in lib/predictions.ts
```

#### 2. SEC API Rate Limit Exceeded
**Symptom**: 429 errors from SEC EDGAR
**Cause**: Exceeding 10 requests/second

**Fix**:
```python
# In scripts/extract-real-financial-data.py
time.sleep(0.12)  # 120ms = 8.3 req/sec (safe margin)
```

#### 3. Claude API Quota Exceeded
**Symptom**: Anthropic API 429 errors
**Cause**: Exceeded rate limits or monthly quota

**Fix**:
- Implement exponential backoff
- Cache sentiment analyses
- Upgrade Anthropic plan

#### 4. Missing Financial Data
**Symptom**: XBRL extraction returns null
**Causes**:
- Non-standard XBRL tags
- Foreign companies (IFRS vs US-GAAP)
- 8-K filings without financials

**Fix**:
- Add fallback XBRL tag names
- Filter to 10-K/10-Q only for financial predictions
- Implement manual overrides for key companies

## üéì Model Improvement Research

### Why Real Data Underperforms Simulated (56.8% vs 65.1%)

**Hypothesis 1: Simulation Bias**
- Simulated data assumed 69% of EPS beats have positive returns
- Reality: Only 55.6% of beats are correct
- Conclusion: Market is less predictable than academic studies suggest

**Hypothesis 2: Missing Features**
- Real model lacks sentiment analysis (not yet integrated)
- Real model lacks risk score deltas (extracted but not used)
- Expected gain: +5-8 percentage points

**Hypothesis 3: EPS Miss Behavior**
- Simulated: Misses have 59.8% accuracy
- Real: Misses have 57.4% accuracy (actually better!)
- Insight: Market doesn't punish misses as hard as expected
- Action: Reduce EPS miss penalties in model

### Next Research Questions

1. **Why do EPS inline filings have 75% accuracy?**
   - Hypothesis: No surprise = predictable market reaction
   - Test: Analyze inline filings separately

2. **Why do large caps ($200-500B) outperform?**
   - Hypothesis: Optimal size for institutional support + volatility
   - Test: Add institutional ownership data

3. **Why did simulated data overfit?**
   - Hypothesis: Circular logic (simulated from actual returns)
   - Solution: Use real consensus estimates instead
