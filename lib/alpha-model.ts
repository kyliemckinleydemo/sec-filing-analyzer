/**
 * @module lib/alpha-model
 * @description Stepwise+Ridge regression model predicting 30-day market-relative alpha using 8 features from SEC filings, trained on 340 samples with fixed coefficients for deterministic scoring
 *
 * PURPOSE:
 * - Calculate standardized alpha scores by applying Ridge regression weights to 8 features (price momentum, analyst activity, AI sentiment)
 * - Classify predictions as LONG/SHORT/NEUTRAL with high/medium/low confidence based on training distribution percentiles
 * - Extract model features from company, filing, and analyst activity data ensuring ratio-based price calculations
 * - Provide per-feature contribution breakdown showing which signals drive the alpha prediction
 *
 * EXPORTS:
 * - AlphaFeatures (interface) - Shape with 8 numeric features: priceToLow, majorDowngrades, analystUpsidePotential, priceToHigh, concernLevel, marketCap, sentimentScore, upgradesLast30d
 * - AlphaPrediction (interface) - Shape with rawScore, expectedAlpha, signal (LONG/SHORT/NEUTRAL), confidence level, percentile, featureContributions map, and predicted30dReturn
 * - predictAlpha (function) - Accepts AlphaFeatures, returns AlphaPrediction with standardized score and classification
 * - extractAlphaFeatures (function) - Converts company/filing/analystActivity records into AlphaFeatures using ratio calculations and fallback to training means
 *
 * PATTERNS:
 * - Call extractAlphaFeatures({ company, filing, analystActivity }) to build features from database records
 * - Pass features to predictAlpha(features) which returns signal, confidence, and expectedAlpha percentage
 * - Check prediction.signal === 'LONG' && prediction.confidence === 'high' for top 10% percentile entries (>90th)
 * - Use prediction.featureContributions to debug which features pushed score bullish/bearish
 *
 * CLAUDE NOTES:
 * - CRITICAL: priceToHigh and priceToLow MUST be ratios (e.g., 0.88, 1.27), NOT percentages (-12.0, +27.0) — training stats confirm ratio scale with mean=0.8588 and 1.3978
 * - Model replaces three previous systems: RandomForest (CV R²=-0.067), Logistic Regression baseline, and rule-based engine — this fixed-formula approach prevents overfitting on small dataset
 * - Uses frozen training statistics (FEATURE_STATS) for z-score normalization — never recalculate these means/stds or model breaks
 * - Backtested 56.3% directional accuracy overall, 62.5% for high-confidence signals with +7.64pp long-short spread on high-conf subset
 * - extractAlphaFeatures falls back to training means when data missing (e.g., no analyst target price) to prevent NaN propagation

/**
 * Alpha Prediction Model — Stepwise+Ridge (8 features)
 *
 * Predicts 30-day market-relative alpha (stock return minus S&P 500 return).
 * Trained on 340 SEC filings with 5-fold TimeSeriesSplit cross-validation.
 * CV R² = 0.043 ± 0.056
 *
 * Replaces:
 *   - lib/ml-prediction.ts (RandomForest via predict_single_filing.py)
 *   - lib/baseline-features.ts (Logistic Regression via predict_baseline.py)
 *   - The rule-based engine in lib/predictions.ts
 *
 * Why this model wins over the existing RandomForest:
 *   - RF had CV R² = -0.067 (worse than predicting the mean)
 *   - RF overfits with max_depth=10 on n=352 samples
 *   - RF retrained from CSV on every call (no stability)
 *   - This model is a fixed formula — deterministic, fast, no Python needed
 *
 * Backtested directional accuracy:
 *   All signals: 56.3% (80/142)
 *   High confidence: 62.5% (30/48)
 *   LONG-SHORT spread: +3.73pp (high-conf: +7.64pp)
